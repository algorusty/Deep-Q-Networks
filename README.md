## Overview

This codebase is designed to generate text sequences using a combination of transformers and reinforcement learning. The primary components are a transformer model for language generation and a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for action selection and learning.

## Dependencies

The code relies on the following libraries:

- `torch`
- `torch.nn`
- `torch.optim`
- `torch.nn.functional`
- `numpy`
- `random`
- `transformers`

## Key Components

### Transformer Model

The transformer model is loaded using the `transformers` library. The model is used to generate text sequences and compute embeddings for semantic similarity calculations.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name_or_path = "fblgit/juanako-7b-UNA"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path, low_cpu_mem_usage=True)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path)
```

### DQN Network and Agent

The DQN Network is a simple feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer. The DQN Agent uses this network to select actions (i.e., generate tokens) and learn from the rewards it receives.

```python
class DQNNetwork(nn.Module):
    ...

class DQNAgent:
    ...
```

### OrcaDQN

The `OrcaDQN` class combines the transformer model and the DQN agent to generate text sequences. It uses the DQN agent to select actions and updates the agent based on the rewards it receives.

```python
class OrcaDQN:
    ...
```

## Usage

To use the code, you need to initialize the DQN Agent and the OrcaDQN instance, and then call the `train` function.

```python
state_size = 512
action_size = tokenizer.vocab_size
hidden_size = 128
learning_rate = 0.001
gamma = 0.99
target_context = "Your target context here"

dqn_agent = DQNAgent(state_size, action_size, hidden_size, learning_rate, gamma)
orca_dqn = OrcaDQN(model, dqn_agent, tokenizer)

train(orca_dqn, dqn_agent, num_episodes=100, target_context=target_context)
```

## Reward Functions

The code includes several reward functions that can be used to guide the generation process. These include `compute_fluency`, `diversity`, `compute_relevance`, and `compute_perplexity`. The `compute_reward` function combines these individual rewards into a total reward.

```python
def compute_fluency(sequence):
    ...

def diversity(text):
    ...

def compute_relevance(sequence, target_context):
    ...

def compute_perplexity(sequence):
    ...

def compute_reward(input_ids, next_token_id, target_context=None):
    ...
```

## Note

The code assumes that the input to the DQN agent is a tensor of token IDs with a size of 512. If your input is different, you may need to adjust the `state_size` and the `pad_or_truncate` function accordingly.
